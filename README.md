### Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to get a better understanding of the data and go through Data Assessing And Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
### Implemented Feature Engineering using Recursive Feature Elimination Algorithm (RFE). BUILT many models such linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor algorithms to select the best one.
### Monitored The performance and apply the necessary changes to the model algorithm and code by Implemented K fold Cross Validation AfterModel Selection phase to make sure that the model performed precisely.
